# To-Do Manager

Web application for managing To-Do Items

## Demo

Demo instance of the hosted application: [uitodo.vorozhbit.com](https://uitodo.vorozhbit.com/) 

## Features
- User can create, edit, and remove to-do items organizing them into different to-do lists;
- Items within the list can be marked as "completed" and grouped by the completion status;
- Each list has a unique URL that can be shared with another user;
- Users can edit the same list: all the changes are reflected in real-time for all users;
- All the data (items and lists) is saved in the database;
- Links to created or visited lists are stored in the user's browser and displayed in the UI.

## Implemented User Stories

#### 1. I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list.

#### 2. I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we can (for example) edit our family shopping-list together.

#### 3. I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus on things that are still pending.

#### 4. I as a user can filter the to-do list and view items that were marked as done - so that I can retrospect on my prior progress.

#### 5. I as a user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has its unique URL that I can share with my friends - so that I could have separate to-do lists for my groceries and work related tasks.

#### 6. I as a user can be sure that my todos will be persisted so that important information is not lost when server restarts
